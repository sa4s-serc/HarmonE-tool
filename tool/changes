writing comments as i go through the steps:
1. have a readme at the outermost directory (containing setup instructions) so that it shows up on opening github. 
2. the command may not be python3 for all. could be python (mostly the case for windows) or python3.11/python3.12, so mention that if possible
3. good job on the comments in the requirements document. it does mention  Flask compatible with Python < 3.11, which I have. will the system fail for 3.11 and 3.12 because thats what most people will use
4. I know it is intuitive for us but mention opening a new terminal for step 4.2. Someone without enough technical dexterity will Ctrl-C the main application to run this
5. make http://localhost:8000/acp_dashboard.html a clickable link instead of a comment so its easier to notice and follow
6. make things easier for the user by having a preset already selected by default. mention it can be changed
7. it would be better if you could directly write the file to the policies/ folder. should be possible, if not, atleast mention that 'Place the policy file in the policies/ folder' is only required for ones without presets. Its already there there for the ones with presets so i believe nothing is to be downloaded or placed.
8. write to the approach.conf file based on the selected approach. the user should not have to navigate back to the codebase for this step.
