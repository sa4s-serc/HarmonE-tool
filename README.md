# Harmonica Website

This repository contains the website for the Harmonica exemplar: **"A Self-Adaptation Exemplar for Sustainable MLOps"**.

## About

This website presents the research submitted to SEAMS 2026 on self-adaptive systems for sustainable Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). The HarmonE approach integrates Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute-Knowledge (MAPE-K) control loops into MLOps pipelines to enable sustainable and resilient machine learning systems.
