# HarmonE Research Website

This repository contains the website for the HarmonE research project: **"A Self-Adaptive Approach for Sustainable MLOps Pipeline Management"**.

## About

This website presents the research submitted to SEAMS 2026 on self-adaptive systems for sustainable Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). The HarmonE approach integrates Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute-Knowledge (MAPE-K) control loops into MLOps pipelines to enable sustainable and resilient machine learning systems.

## Website Structure

- `index.html` - Main research website with paper content, methodology, and evaluation results
- `static/` - Website assets including CSS, JavaScript, images, and demo videos

## Research Links
